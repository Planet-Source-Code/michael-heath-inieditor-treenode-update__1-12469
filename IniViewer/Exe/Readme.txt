* IniEditor v1xx -- Previously known as IniViewer.
 
* Major changes to IniViewer to make it IniEditor:
   1) Added Popup Menu - Right Click
   2) Added Insert Functionality
   3) Added Delete Functionality
   4) Save Changes To Ini File
   5) Created an Edit Command Button
   6) Init Path Fixed to C:\Windows - Sorry for those that use a different path
   7) Added Status Bar and moved the Edit button to the status bar

* Limitation:
   1) Can only edit true ini files 
      with no comments or other
      garbage in them - *Extra Data Lost*
   2) Largest ini file to edit - 64k
 
* Suggestions/Comments:
   Email me any suggestions or comments about IniEditor
   at mheath@indy.net.  Any ideas you would like to see
   implemented in a later version?  Right off, I don't
   know why I would need another version, but if anyone
   has any ideas to contribute or would like to see in
   it, let me know.
   Thanks for downloading my code.  Please vote if you like this
   project.  Let me know if you have found it to be useful.
